# SNHU CS Capstone Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my SNHU Computer Science Capstone CS 499 Portfolio Am Nikita Wadhawan. This repository showcases my final project, focusing on software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The project aims to demonstrate my skills and knowledge gained throughout the Computer Science program.

## Project Overview
The project involves a travel booking website designed to provide users with an intuitive and efficient online booking experience. It includes a detailed exploration of software design patterns, optimization of algorithms for better performance, and effective database management to ensure scalability and security.

### Original Artifacts
The original codebase includes three main components:
- **Software Design and Engineering**: Focused on the architectural design and implementation of the website.
- **Algorithms and Data Structure**: Emphasized the optimization of search algorithms for finding travel deals.
- **Databases**: Concentrated on the schema design and query optimization for the booking system.

### Enhanced Artifacts
Enhancements were made to improve the project's functionality, performance, and user experience:
- **Software Design and Engineering**: [Link to enhanced component]
- **Algorithms and Data Structure**: [Link to enhanced component]
- **Databases**: [Link to enhanced component]

Each enhanced artifact demonstrates significant improvements in code quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Written Narratives
For a detailed description of the journey and the thought process behind each enhancement, please refer to the narratives provided in the repository:
- [Software Design Narrative](/Narratives/Software_Design_Narrative.md)
- [Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative](/Narratives/Algorithms_DataStructure_Narrative.md)
- [Databases Narrative](/Narratives/Databases_Narrative.md)

## Code Review
A comprehensive code review video is available where I discuss the enhancements made to the project, highlighting the challenges faced and how they were overcome. [[Link to code review video](https://youtu.be/e2RpZbG04i0)]

## Navigating the Repository
This repository is organized into several main directories:
- `Original_Artifacts/`: Contains the original codebase and documentation.
- `Enhanced_Artifacts/`: Includes the enhanced versions of the original artifacts.
- `Narratives/`: Houses the written narratives documenting the enhancement journey.

## Conclusion
This portfolio represents the culmination of my learning and growth in the Computer Science program at SNHU. Through this project, I have demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, solve complex problems, and continuously learn and adapt to new challenges.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope it provides insight into my skills and capabilities as a software developer.
